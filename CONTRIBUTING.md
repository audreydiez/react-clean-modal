## I have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [issues](https://github.com/audreydiez/react-clean-modal/issues)
and read the project [Documentation](https://github.com/audreydiez/react-clean-modal/blob/main/README.md).

If you then still the need to ask a question and need clarification, follow this:

* **Open [issues](https://github.com/audreydiez/react-clean-modal/issues)**
* **Choose a [question label](https://github.com/audreydiez/react-clean-modal/labels)**
* **Provide as much context** as you about what you're running into
* **Provide project and platforms versions**

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible


## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files, and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
